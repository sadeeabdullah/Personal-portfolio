                <p className="">Having completed my Secondary School Certificate (SSC) in 2020, I embarked on a journey in Computer Science and Technology for my diploma. This educational pursuit has been a gateway to my exploration of the vast realm of software development. Envisioning the end of my diploma by 2024, I am passionately diving into the software development field, aiming to broaden my horizons. Post-graduation, I aspire to venture abroad, seeking new perspectives and opportunities to further enrich my skills and expertise in this dynamic domain.</p>
